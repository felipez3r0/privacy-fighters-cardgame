# Privacy Fighters Cardgame - Rules (English)
Fight for your privacy and protect your data!

2-4 players have to fight against big companies each turn to protect their personal data, the last one standing is the winner!

## Basic rules
Requirements for the game:
- Companies Cards
- Protection Cards
- 4 information markers/counters (for each player)

*Goal*
Players start at level 1 of protection and must reach level 20. The first to reach level 20 is the winner.

Players who lose their 4 information counters will be out of the game.

* Letters *
Companies Cards are the opponents of the players, each card has a level of strength and information of the prize for being able to defeat it.

Protection cards are cards that the player can equip to increase their level of protection and fight against companies.

*Preparation*
The first step is to separate the Protection cards and Companies cards into two mounds.

Each player receives their information counters and players set the order of turns as they prefer.

Before starting each player receives 1 protection card.

* Game / Round *
The first player flips a Companies Card that will be his opponent in that round, to win the player must have a level of protection greater than the level of the company.
- If the level of the player is greater he protects himself of the company and receives the award indicated.
- If the level is lower he loses one of his information markers and receives 1 protection card (he is being cautious from now on!).

*End of the game*
Rounds follow this format until one of the players reaches protection level 20 or until only one player with information marker remains.
